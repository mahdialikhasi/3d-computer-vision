Consider 4 points with cartesian coordinates of (-1,-1), (-1,1), (1,-1) and (1,1). These 4 points form a square in plane.

### Part a
Plot this square.

### Part b
Transform these points with Rigid-body, similarity, affine, and projective Transformations and plot the tetrahedral outputs. Transform parameters should be obtained interactively from the user.

### Part c
Write a code to check whether length, angles, and parallelism attributes have been preserved or not.

### Part d.
Transform the square with different Rigid-body transformations two times in a row. Vary the order you apply the transformations and plot the results. Are the results identical? If not, check whether the objectâ€™s orientation is the same in both of the outcomes (The final objects have the same orientation if we can transform one to the other using translation). Do these properties hold in 3D space?
